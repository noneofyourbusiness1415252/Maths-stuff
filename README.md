This program currently identifies primes, composites, squares and cubes.   
To get started, just type a number from 1-4 to choose one of the options.   
When finding squares/cubes/primes/composites in a certain range, the first number you will be asked for will be the **start** of the range, and the second number the **end** of the range, ***including itself***.  
Currently, the option to find squares, cubes, composites and primes is a bit glitchy with brackets and apostrophes everywhere. Basically the first 2 numbers are the numbers you **chose**, the rest of them are **what you were looking for.**
