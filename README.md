Hello there and welcome to my Maths stuff!
This program currently identifies primes, composites, squares and cubes from within a range of number/s that you specify.   
To get started, just type a number from 1-4 to choose one of the options.   
All inputs must be written in integers (whole numbers). For the switching modes option, it allows you to switch modes if you type 'yes' in lowercase, uppercase or a mix, otherwise it continues on the same mode.
When finding squares/cubes/primes/composites in a certain range, the first number you will be asked for will be the **start** of the range, and the second number the **end** of the range, ***including itself***.  
Currently, the option to find squares, cubes, composites and primes is buggy with brackets and apostrophes everywhere, so just ignore all the brackets and apostrophes then it'll make sense.  
Hope you like this tool! Have a good day!
