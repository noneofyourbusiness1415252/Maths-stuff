[Typewriter Effect](https://www.loom.com/share/1096805bfb5d4819be558462933c6a5c)

Hello there and welcome to my Maths stuff!
This program currently identifies primes, composites, squares and cubes from within a range of number/s that you specify. It also includes quizzes about primes, squares and cubes.
To get started, just type a number from 1-7 to choose one of the options.   
All inputs must be written in integers (whole numbers). For the switching modes option, it allows you to switch modes if you type 'yes' in lowercase, uppercase or a mix, otherwise it continues on the same mode. For the typewriter effect speed, you can write any positive integer
## Primes/squares/cubes in range calculator
When finding squares/cubes/primes/composites in a certain range, the first number you will be asked for will be the **start** of the range, and the second number the **end** of the range, ***including itself***.
## Quiz  
For the square/cube quiz, type *square* if you think it is square, *cube* if you think it is cube, *both* if you think it is both square and cube, and *neither* if you think it is neither square nor cube.
## How questions are picked
The numbers picked increase depending on the difficulty.
The range of numbers is the amount that you put in, for example if you put in 20, it has a range of:  
First question: 0-19
Second question: 20-40   

The question is randomly chosen from the range. If there are squares/cubes or primes (depending on the type of quiz you are doing), it is more likely that those are chosen. 

## Typewriter Effect!
When choosing typewriter effect, the speed actually increases with a lower number because it is measured in ***average*** **seconds between each letter**.
So if you type in 0.1, 0.1 is multiplied by 2 to make 0.2, and the delay between each letter is a random number between 0 and 0.2 seconds. So it averages out to 0.1 seconds. 
The reason I made it like this instead of a fixed delay is so that it feels more natural, because you never type each letter with the exact same speed
## (Multi)Coloured text  
When you first use the program, you are asked if you want to turn on multicoloured text. Then it asks you to pick which colours you want in the text. The more times you type a colour, the more times it appears compared to the other colours.  
Example:  
Cyan typed twice, red typed once, magenta typed thrice.  
Result: 1/2 of the text is magenta, 1/3 is cyan, 1/6 is red. 
# What I'm currently working on
I'm working on adding a discord bot with this program, as my friend Ammaar suggested.

Hope you like this tool! Have a good day!
